        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          In 2021, we set out to bring cooks together from all over to exchange
          recipes and to support each other in the kitchen. We wanted to create
          a buzzing place for others who do what we do all day long: talk about
          food! On Food Network you can find daily recipes submitted by our
          large community and cooked by our editors in our very own test
          kitchens. Whether you’re new to Food Network or have been around for a
          while, we’re so glad you’re here.

            <h3>Laska Pasta</h3>
            <h4>Difficulty: Medium</h4>
            <p>
              East meets West in this pasta dish inspired by the flavors of one
              of Southeast Asia’s popular noodle soups -laksa! Finishing the
              pasta in the sauce ensures that the noodles are well-coated and al
              dente.

            <h3>Spring Vegetable Salad</h3>
            <h4>Difficulty: Easy</h4>
            <p>
              Blanching spring vegetables sets their color and texture so the
              salad is extra-sweet and crisp. Shallow-frying eggs in hot oil
              gives the whites a lacy texture around the edges, while keeping
              the yolks soft and runny.

            <h3>Fried-Avocado Tacos</h3>
            <h4>Difficulty: Hard</h4>
            <p>
              Deep frying avocados creates a great contrast between crisp
              exterior and creamy center. The batter is made with a combination
              of wheat flour and cornstarch for more crispness and less
              toughness.
