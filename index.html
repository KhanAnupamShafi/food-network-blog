        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          In 2021, we set out to bring cooks together from all over to exchange
          recipes and to support each other in the kitchen. We wanted to create
          a buzzing place for others who do what we do all day long: talk about
          food! On Food Network you can find daily recipes submitted by our
          large community and cooked by our editors in our very own test
          kitchens. Whether you’re new to Food Network or have been around for a
          while, we’re so glad you’re here.

            <h3>Laska Pasta</h3>
            <h4>Difficulty: Medium</h4>
            <p>
              East meets West in this pasta dish inspired by the flavors of one
              of Southeast Asia’s popular noodle soups -laksa! Finishing the
              pasta in the sauce ensures that the noodles are well-coated and al
              dente.

            <h3>Spring Vegetable Salad</h3>
            <h4>Difficulty: Easy</h4>
            <p>
              Blanching spring vegetables sets their color and texture so the
              salad is extra-sweet and crisp. Shallow-frying eggs in hot oil
              gives the whites a lacy texture around the edges, while keeping
              the yolks soft and runny.

            <h3>Fried-Avocado Tacos</h3>
            <h4>Difficulty: Hard</h4>
            <p>
              Deep frying avocados creates a great contrast between crisp
              exterior and creamy center. The batter is made with a combination
              of wheat flour and cornstarch for more crispness and less
              toughness.

          <br />
          In a time when much of the world is facing lockdown because of the
          coronavirus pandemic, unable to see family and friends in person, many
          of us are turning to food for comfort. Different dishes are considered
          comfort food around the world, but they’re all typically high in
          sugar, fat, and salt. These flavors are key in not only making us feel
          happy but also in solidifying these dishes in our memories. Twenty
          people from different cultural backgrounds shared what their favorite
          comfort food is and what it means to them, and we looked at how their
          dish of choice is made.
